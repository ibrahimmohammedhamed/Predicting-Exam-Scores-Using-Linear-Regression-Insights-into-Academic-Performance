# Predicting-Exam-Scores-Using-Linear-Regression-Insights-into-Academic-Performance
A data-driven project aimed at understanding the factors influencing academic performance. By leveraging multiple linear regression, we predict student exam scores based on study habits, parental involvement, and other critical features. This repository contains all code, analysis, and visualizations used in the project.

2. Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between various factors (e.g., study hours, attendance, motivation) and academic performance. Using multiple linear regression, we predict student exam scores and provide actionable insights for improving educational outcomes.

3. Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to uncover relationships between features and exam scores.
Machine Learning Model: A linear regression model for predicting exam scores.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations based on the modelâ€™s findings to improve student performance.

5. Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
